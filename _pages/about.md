I am an incoming Tenure Track Assistant Professor at [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](https://english.sufe.edu.cn/) (SUFE) in the School of Computing and Artificial Intelligence. Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. at [MLO, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/), fortunately advised by Prof. [Martin Jaggi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r1TJBr8AAAAJ&hl=en). I received the Master of Science degree from EPFL and Bachelor of Science degree from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC).
